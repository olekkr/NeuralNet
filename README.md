### Description:
- NeuralNet.py is a library with all the necessary functions, classes etc. for dataexploration.

- application.py is a executable, for testing/example of how to use library.


### Todo:
 - Revise metrics such that there are continous metrics and final metrics.
 - Add more metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
 - Add trainWithMetric(self, *metrics) - > [[loss, metric], ...].
 - Add a plotter class, That works on top of EvalHandler
 - Train neuralnets
 - evalute them
 - Profit!
